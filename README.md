### UCF Parallel Computing (Dechev)

**note: the code currently does not compile!!!**

Our midterm report should be found in this folder.

## Compilation (lol not yet)
This program was developed with POSIX threads, so it will only be compatible on Unix systems. Please test on UCF Eustis or another Linux/MacOS environment.
Instructions for connecting to Eustis can be found [here](http://www.cs.ucf.edu/~wocjan/Teaching/2016_Fall/cop3402/2_homeworks/eustis_tutorial.pdf). 
```
$ g++ lfcas.cpp
$ ./a.out
